# Mock eCommerce Website

This is a mock eCommerce web application created using Vite with React + TypeScript on the frontend and Node.js + TypeScript on the backend. This project demonstrates a basic eCommerce flow from product selection to checkout, including functionality to add products to a cart, manage quantities, and perform a test payment.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of products with basic details.
- **Product Detail Page**: Shows detailed information about each product.
- **Cart Page**: Allows users to view items added to the cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- **Wishlist Page**: Users can add products to their wishlist for later viewing.
- **Checkout Page**: Users can review their cart items before payment.
- **Mock Payment Gateway**: A simulated payment flow is available to complete the checkout process.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Vite**: For fast build and development.
- **React**: Component-based library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better code organization.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express**: Lightweight framework for handling routes and API endpoints.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and cleaner code.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Contains the React components, pages, and logic to manage cart and wishlist in local storage.
- **Backend**: Handles API requests and serves product data from a constant file.
